# RedHat PoC

TimberFire will like to work on a PoC with Red Hat and one of their customers: **Sapiens Inc.**
<br/>

Sapiens is building an online retail application that specifically requires a NoSQL database, a PostgreSQL Database and a Queue.

Before the PoC work starts Red Hat will like to show TimberFire and Sapiens Engineering Leadership a Demo of their Primaza v0.1 release to gauge whether there are any missing requirements that can be addressed in parallel while the PoC is being run.
