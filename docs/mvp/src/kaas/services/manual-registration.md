# Service Administrator: Manual registration

The Service Administrator knows that they had already deployed but never used an RDS Postgres Database.
They thinks the Application Developer may use this unused database.

As they got all the information needed by the Application Developer to connect to the database, they manually creates a RegisteredService for the RDS Database.
