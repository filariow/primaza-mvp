# Service Administrator: Manual registration

The Service Administrator knows that he had already deployed an unused RDS Postgres Database.
He think he may allow the Application Developer to use this unused database.

As he got all the information needed by the Application Developer to connect to the database, he manually creates a RegisteredService for the RDS Database.
